## GitHub Source Code Leak

_Insights from [Resynth](https://github.com/resynth1943)_

In a suspicious [commit](https://web.archive.org/web/20201104050026if_/https://github.com/github/dmca/tree/565ece486c7c1652754d7b6d2b5ed9cb4097f9d5) to the official GitHub DMCA repository, an unknown individual uploaded the confidential source code, impersonating Nat Friedman using a bug in GitHub's application.

Perhaps GitHub is 12 years late in finally revealing their source code to the public; and maybe this is just what we need.More [here](https://resynth1943.net/articles/github-source-code-leak/).
