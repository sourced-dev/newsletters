1. GitHub Source Code Leak

Insights from Resynth.

In a suspicious commit to the official GitHub DMCA repository, an unknown individual uploaded the confidential source code, impersonating Nat Friedman using a bug in GitHub's application.

Perhaps GitHub is 12 years late in finally revealing their source code to the public; and maybe this is just what we need. More here.

Repos / Tools 🛠

This week’s theme is serverless. A paradigm that we’ve been spending a ton of time on.

```
Dashbird: Dashbird is the central data platform for your serverless environment. Logs, metrics, traces, and configuration data collected automatically for all serverless services (Lambda, DynamoDB, SQS, API Gateway, etc.).

Begin: Begin is a ridiculously quick platform for building modern web apps, sites, & APIs. Get started for free, no credit card required.

Autocode: Build webhooks, scripts and integrate APIs. When AWS is overkill, use Autocode to go from prototype to production-hosted in minutes.

Pipedream: Pipedream is a serverless integration and compute platform that makes it easy to connect apps and develop event-driven workflows. 

🔥 Bonus points because we use Pipedream here at Source Code.🔥
